    <p>IGS is a graphic library that enables the user to easily
      programmatically define graphics in two or three dimensions. Basic
      idea of IGS is to enable the user programming of graphics without
      worrying about how to implement rotations of graphic objects,
      surface hiding in three dimensions, output in different graphic
      formats and similar things. </p>

    <center><b><i><font color="#008000"><font size="+1">Technical
              Aspects of the System</font></font></i></b></center>
    <p>How the system is built can be best seen from a <b><i><font
            size="+1"><a href="igs.gif">scheme</a></font></i></b> of a
      typical IGS-based application (you can download <a
        href="igssl.ps">the same scheme in PostScript</a> and view it
      with <a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/index.html">Ghostview</a>).

    </p>
    <p>The most basic part of the system is a simple graphic interface
      (module <b><i><font color="#FF1493">grint</font></i></b>) which
      can be based on an arbitrary graphic library installed on the
      machine where IGS is used. This interface is the only part of IGS
      which is platform dependent, all other parts need only standard
      ANSI C for compilation. So, if you want to build IGS on a
      different platform, only this module must be reprogrammed. This is
      usually not a hard task because module <b><i><font
            color="#FF1493">grint</font></i></b> contains only the most
      basic graphic functions such as for opening and closing windows,
      drawing primitives (lines, triangles, fourangles, circles, faces,
      text) in a window, etc. The first library on which module <b><i><font
            color="#FF1493">grint</font></i></b> (and IGS) was built was
      PEXlib. Later IGS was also built on Borland's BGI (which did not
      work out very well because of problems with memory - BGI runs only
      on DOS) and Xlib. Implementation built on Xlib is presently the
      most often used; there can still be some problems with colors an
      fonts with this implementation, but otherways it works quite well
      and is much faster than the implementation built on PEXlib). </p>
    <p>The central part of IGS is module <b><i><font color="#FF1493">gro</font></i></b>.
      This module contains the definitions which constitute the basic
      concepts of graphic objects construction and manipulation in IGS.
      It includes the definitions of data types with which graphic
      objects are represented. </p>
    <p>Further on, it includes auxiliary functions for construction of
      complex graphic objects. </p>
    <p>Functions for manipulation of graphics objects follow, i.e.
      functions for different kinds of geometric transforms, for sorting
      primitive objects according to their depth, etc. </p>
    <p>Another part of this module takes care of plotting of complex
      graphic objects on screen and to files in different formats. This
      part is unified in new versions of IGS (in old versions there were
      separated sub-modules for plotting in different formats). IGS
      currently supports output of graphics in various formats such as <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl" moz-do-not-send="true">Tcl</a>,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostScript"
        moz-do-not-send="true">PostScript</a>, and <a
        moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoCAD_DXF">DXF</a>. A
      plotting part of the <i>gro</i> module includes many auxiliary
      functions that help to achieve a specific look of graphs, such as
      functions for lighting and plotting in different perspectives. </p>
    <p>Beside the basic modules described above, IGS is extended with
      some higher level modules. These modules provide functions for
      construction of graphic objects which are often used in graphs,
      for example different kinds of grids, simple function plots,
      parametric function plots, polar plots etc. The <b><i><font
            color="#FF1493">gr3d</font></i></b> module provides a set of
      such functions for plotting in three dimensions, while the <b><i><font
            color="#FF1493">gr2d</font></i></b> module provides similar
      functions for plotting in two dimensions. Development of
      additional module which will provide some FEM post-processing
      extensions was started in May 1997. These modules can read finite
      element meshes and values of various calculated quantities
      (temperatures, displacements, velocities, strains, stresses, etc.)
      from simulation input and result files, and presents them
      graphically on screen or exports them to graphic files.<br>
    </p>
    <center><b><i><font color="#FF1493">Using IGS in Applications</font></i></b></center>
    <p>It is quite simple to use IGS in an application. Basic steps of
      plotting a graph in an application using IGS are shown in this <a
        href="igs.gif">figure</a>. </p>
    <p>First, graphic objects are constructed for things user wants to
      plot. This is the only step user must program alone. Therefore the
      only graphic thing users must care about when using IGS is how the
      graph he wants to produce and plot is built in sense of primitive
      graphic objects like lines and faces. Auxiliary functions for
      construction of complex graphics objects using primitive objects
      are provided by the <b><i><font color="#FF1493">gro</font></i></b>
      module.</p>
    <p>The next step is putting primitives from a tree structure created
      by the user to a stack. This must be doe only at plotting in three
      dimensions as a preparation for sorting graphic primitives by
      their depth. Functions for this task are provided in module <b><i><font
            color="#FF1493">gro</font></i></b>. </p>
    <p>Before plotting can start, initialization of graphic interface
      must be done and windows must be open using functions from module
      <b><i><font color="#FF1493">grint</font></i></b>. </p>
    <p>Plotting can now be performed in a loop. All tasks are performed
      by functions from module <b><i><font color="#FF1493">gro</font></i></b>:
      First, geometric transformations are applied to graphic object and
      geometric limits are set. Next, primitives are sorted by their
      depth and finally they are plotted one by one in order to obtain a
      possibly three-dimensional plot of our graph. If necessary, user
      can export a plot to a file in one of the formats supported by
      IGS. </p>

    <p>IGS is a shortcut for "Igor's Graphic System". IGS is primarily
      used internally in C3M and by our partners). I began to develop it
      in April 1996. By the end of 1996, IGS was sufficiently developed
      to be used for building applications with it. In February 1997, I
      started with introduction of IGS to other members of our staff,
      who made their first applications based on IGS in spring. My goal
      is to encourage other members of staff to use IGS in their
      applications so that IGS would begin to live. Another goal is to
      draw another people in development of the system itself to gain
      experience in close team work. </p>
