# Test Page 

This is a test page at ajgorhoe.github.io/igor, which should map to the URL https://ajgorhoe.gitgub.io/igor/TestPage . This is only true when the site is set up by Jekyll. If Jekyll is not set up, you will not see this web page, and only the HTML pages wil lbe visible on the site. See the following:

* [GitHub Pages and Jekyll](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll)
  * [Quickstart for GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart) for a more condensed quick start
